## Objective
Our objective is to build a unified decentralized educational platform that enables Universities and Schools of any size to rapidly implement the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts on various application needs.
<br>
We believe that Blockchain technology can be used as a powerful tool to improve the  current Education system and Learning Management System. Unifinity DAPP will enable users as Parents, Students and Management to have full and simple insight and control of all related data. We have created our own Dapp as a dynamic Interface, connecting all blockchain innovation partners ands processes, by providing the necessary infrastructure and a set of integrated tools. It will empower Universities to manage blockchain features and applications at a fraction of the cost and time. 

## Collaborative Model
We are working with a collaborative model which allows us to bring in complementary emerging technology and blockchain expertise, and will offer comprehensive blockchain-based solutions formulated allowing the universities to synchronize with and use the blockchain applications to enhance their administrative processes.

## Empowering the Youth and EdTech Enhancements

5.1 Billion over 7.8 billion of the global population around the world are using mobile phones meaning 68% of the population have access to information and resources 24/7. The opportunities on using the mobile as a way to spread the awareness and content are limitless, borderless, and instantaneous. 

To leverage the learning experience using modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners are one of the challenges of the current education system. Most applications developed in Android and IOS are more focused on games, entertainment and social media interaction since these types of applications are much easier to sell to the public leaving the education system and applications more web based resulting in less exposure to the masses.

The model of UNIFINITY as described in this plan calls for engaging and empowering learning experiences of all users. We focus on the behavior of students in social media and their behavior in the classroom and use as the center to empower them by providing them with rewards and a leaderboard where they can see their performance while the UNIFINITY Dapp will measure their overall performance and provide the user Rewards coming from the new batch of Tokens minted being given to the highest point holder.

The Token rewards combined with state-of-the-art technology into learning, enable, motivate, and inspire all students and users to provide personalized learning which enables them to take more professional courses, which will help them in the future to possibly reach a better salary.

## Tokenizing and Gamifications of the Education System 
In a Traditional Classroom set-up, Students are competing with each other on receiving recognition and passing the day to day task and activities inside the classrooms.One of the common issues and time consuming tasks is rating and providing remarks on the students. 
Teachers are consuming extra hours and after school work loads are needed to be allocated by an educator on rating the students; 
Where the Teacher’s work is extended into an extra amount of unpaid hours only to monitor and provide remarks to the students performance, giving them less time on focusing on Quality Learning Materials and lesson plans resulting to poor student’s interaction towards the class and low quality of teaching materials are now presented to the learners. 

Unifinity reward and recognition programs are one method of motivating the users to improve the current workload of an educator by simplifying the remark distribution thru the application while empowering the students to participate more in classes by accelerating their skillset thru the support of Performance Based Rewards Distribution Platform that utilizes the Smart contract and automating the Remark distribution by allocating UNY Points based on the student’s behavior/ activities and completed task which will result to improving their study habits and key behaviors that will benefit the Students and the Teachers.

## Designing a Rewards based on Proof of Activity.
The keys to developing a reward program are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Identification of Institution Activities, Group, Goals that the reward program will support
  <li>Identification of the desired performance or behaviors or Actions that will determine the Rewards Distribution
  <li>Determination of key measurements of the performance or behavior, based on the set Actions and Marks and Data provided by the institution.
  <li>Determination of appropriate rewards
</ul>

In order to provide the functionalities and benefits, In designing and tokenizing a remark Distribution program must identify the institution's goals to be reached and the behaviors or performance that will contribute to this. While this may seem obvious,Institutions frequently commit the mistake of rewarding behaviors or achievements. Determining the Business Model and goals are highly important to improve productivity. 


## Where We are now

Unifinity is in development stage, We are currently enhancing the education system by integrating the features of Blockchain towards the enhancement of the Grading system.
